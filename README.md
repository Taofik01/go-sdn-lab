## ✨ Features

*   **🔍 DNS Resolver:** Resolve domain names to IP addresses (A, AAAA records), mail servers (MX records), and name servers (NS records).
*   **📡 Packet Sniffer:** Capture and analyze network packets, displaying protocol, source/destination IPs, and payload.
*   **💉 Packet Injector:** Inject custom packets with specified protocols and payloads.
*   **🔑 Port Scanner:** Scan for open TCP and UDP ports on a given IP address.
*   **📊 Frequency Analyzer:** Analyze the frequency of characters in a given string.
*   **📝 Sentence Analyzer:** Analyze the frequency of words in a sentence.
*   **🗂️ Word Classifier:** Classify words as alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric.
*   **📝 Packet Analyzer:** Reads in packets from stdin or a file and analyzes them to display frequency
