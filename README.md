# go-sdn-lab

commiting 5 Go programs to learn basics of manipulating SDN networks (
    1. For loops 
    2. Functions with parameters and return values 
    3. Type casting [between integers, float64 and string, etc.] 
    4. Arrays and Slices (append, indexing, lens)
    5. Maps (Create, Insert, Delete, lookup)


# Build a simple SDN network with 3 switches and 3 hosts
## Step 1: Define the network structure
## Step 2: Create a function to add a host to the network
## Step 3: Create a function to add a switch to the network
## Step 4: Create a function to connect two switches
## Step 5: Create a function to connect a host to a switch
## Step 6: Test the network by adding hosts and switches and connecting them
## Step 7: Visualize the network
## Step 8: Add a function to delete a host or switch from the network
## Step 9: Add a function to update the network
## Step 10: Test the network by deleting hosts and switches and updating the network
## Step 11: Visualize the updated network
## Step 12: Add a function to get the network topology
## Step 13: Test the network by getting the network topology
## Step 14: Visualize the network topology
## Step 15: Add a function to get the network status
## Step 16: Test the network by getting the network status
## Step 17: Visualize the network status
## Step 18: Add a function to simulate a network failure
## Step 19: Test the network by simulating a network failure
## Step 20: Visualize the network after the failure
## Step 21: Add a function to recover from a network failure
## Step 22: Test the network by recovering from a network failure
## Step 23: Visualize the network after recovery
## Step 24: Add a function to get the network statistics
## Step 25: Test the network by getting the network statistics

# Build a packet inspection tool  in the next 48 hours
## Step 1: Define the packet structure
## Step 2: Create a function that list all active network interface
## Step 3: Create a function that capture packets on a network interface
## Step 4: Create a function to sniff a packet on a selected interface
## Step 5: Create a function to display the packet details like Logs source IP, destination IP, and protocol to console
## Step 6: Create a function to save the packet details to a file
## Step 7: Test the packet inspection tool
## Step 8: Visualize the packet details


# Goals for the next 30 days 
## By the end of this week Build a CLI tool to view all active network interfaces, their IP addrress and connections on Linux
